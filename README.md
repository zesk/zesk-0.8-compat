# Zesk compatibility with 0.8

This library consists largely of non-zesk namespace class stubs which is useful when migrating from Zesk 0.8 to Zesk 0.9.

Do

	composer require zesk/zesk-0.8-compat
	
To get compatibility for your current project.

*Note that Zesk deprecated calls will be called for any class you use within this toolkit.*
