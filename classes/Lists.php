/**
 * Handles more traditional Cold-Fusion style lists, basically a string separated by characters
 * Lists, by default, are separated by semicolon, ";" but can be separated by any character sequence
 * These are meant to handle simplistic cases, and does not really scale for lists of thousands of items.
 * If that's the case, then use arrays or another structure.
 * 
 * All functions within support array lists as well; the semantic is:
 * - if an array is passed in for a list, then an array is returned
 * - if a delimited-string list is passed in for a list, then a delimited-string list is returned
 *
